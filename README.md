# 🧠 Epileptic Seizure Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **predicting epileptic seizures** using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of EEG recordings, which are analyzed to classify seizure and non-seizure events. This can help in early detection and management of epilepsy.

## 🔬 Dataset
- The dataset contains **EEG (electroencephalogram) signals** recorded from patients.
- It includes multiple classes representing different brain activity states.
- The goal is to classify EEG signals into seizure and non-seizure conditions.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Normalization and feature scaling
   - Feature extraction using statistical and frequency-domain techniques

2. **Model Training**
   - Machine learning models such as **Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks** are used.
   - Deep learning approaches with **CNNs or LSTMs** may be explored for better accuracy.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** are used to measure performance.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sinchanakolur/Epileptic-seizure-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    cd Epileptic-seizure-prediction
   
3.Install required dependencies 
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Run the training script:
    python train_model.py

📈 Results
The model successfully differentiates between seizure and non-seizure EEG signals.
